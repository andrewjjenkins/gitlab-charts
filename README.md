## GitLab Helm Charts

This repo is a collection of GitLab Helm charts. 
The repo automatically publishes to our chart repo, [charts.gitlab.io](https://charts.gitlab.io) via GitLab Pages.

To use the charts, the Helm tool must be installed and initialized. The best
place to start is by reviewing the [Helm Quick Start Guide](https://github.com/kubernetes/helm/blob/master/docs/quickstart.md).

### Usage

Add GitLab Chart Repo:

```bash
$ helm repo add gitlab https://charts.gitlab.io
```

Then you can install charts using the  `gitlab` repo:

```bash
$ helm install gitlab/gitlab
```

Additional installation instructions, including configuration options, can be found in our [documentation](http://docs.gitlab.com/ce/install/kubernetes/).

The charts currently available to install can be found here: <https://gitlab.com/charts/charts.gitlab.io/tree/master/charts>
